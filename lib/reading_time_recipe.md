# {{PROBLEM}} Function Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

_As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute._

## 2. Design the Function Signature

_Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```python


def reading_time(text):
    """Extracts uppercase words from a string

    Parameters: (list all parameters and their types)
        text: a string representing text to read

    Returns: (state the return value and its type)
        a float represting a reading time

    Side effects: (state any side effects)
        This function doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects
    """
    pass # Test-driving means _not_ writing any code here yet.
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a text of 200 words
It will return 1
"""
reading_time('..200..') => 1

"""
Given a text of 300 words
It will return 1
"""
reading_time('..300..') => 1.5

"""
Given a text of 400 words
It will return 1
"""
reading_time('..400..') => 2

"""
Given a text of 100 words
It will return 1
"""
reading_time('..200..') => 0.5
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

Here's an example for you to start with:

```python
# EXAMPLE

from lib.reading_time import *

"""
Given a text of 200 words
It will return 1
"""
def test_reading_time_for_200_is_1():
    criteria = 1
    response = reading_time('one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten')

Ensure all test function names are unique, otherwise pytest will ignore them!
